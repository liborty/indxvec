## Description

This crate is lightweight and has no dependencies.

The facilities provided are:

* ranking, sorting, merging, searching, indexing, selecting, partitioning
* general operations on/with indices
* set operations
* simple and efficient random numbers, mostly for testing
* printing of generic slices and slices of vectors
* macro for easy error reporting

## Usage

#### Import into your source file(s) constants `GR,UN` for colour printing, struct `MinMax`, macro `here!()` and `tof64`  auxiliary function, if needed

`use indxvec::{GR,UN,MinMax,here,tof64};`

#### Use traits `Indices` and/or `Printing`

`use indxvec::{Indices,Printing};`

Trait `Indices` is implemented on type `&[usize]`, i.e. slices of subscripts to slices and vectors.

Trait `Printing` provides utility methods to stringify (serialise for printing) generic slices and slices of vecs.
Optionally, it enables printing in bold green for adding emphasis (see `tests/tests.rs`).

#### Use functions from `merge.rs`

`use indxvec::{merge::*};`

These functions are  applicable to generic slices `&[T]`. Thus they will work on Rust primitive end types, such as f64. They can also work on slices holding any arbitrarily complex end type `T`, as long as the required traits, mostly just `PartialOrd` and/or `Copy`, are  implemented for `T`.

#### Use functions from `random.rs`

`use indxvec::{random::*};`

These functions will create various vectors and vectors of vectors (matrices),
filled with random numbers. Very fast and useful for testing. They take an argument `&mut seed`, declared as follows: `mut seed:u64 = initvalue;`. It can be reset at any time to any new value to initiate a new sequence.

### The following statement will import everything:

`use indxvec::{GR,UN,MinMax,here,tof64,merge::*,random::*,Indices,Printing};`

## Testing

It is highly recommended to read and run `tests/tests.rs` to learn from examples of usage. Use a single thread to run them. It may be a bit slower but it will write the results in the right order:

`cargo test --release -- --test-threads=1 --nocapture --color always`

## Trait Indices

The methods of this trait are implemented for slices of subscripts, i.e. they take the type `&[usize]` as input (self) and produce new index `Vec<usize>`, new data vector `Vec<T>`, or other results as appropriate:

```Rust
/// Methods to manipulate indices of `Vec<usize>` type.
pub trait Indices {
    /// Reverse an index slice by simple reverse iteration.
    fn revindex(self) -> Vec<usize>;
    /// Invert an index.
    fn invindex(self) -> Vec<usize>;
    /// Complement of an index - turns ranks from/to ascending/descending
    fn complindex(self) -> Vec<usize>;
    /// Collect values from `v` in the order of index in self. Or opposite order.
    fn unindex<T: Copy>(self, v:&[T], ascending:bool) -> Vec<T>;
    /// Collects values from v, as f64s, in the order given by self index.    
    fn unindexf64<T: Copy>(self, v:&[T], ascending: bool) -> Vec<f64> where f64:From<T>;
    /// Pearson's correlation coefficient of two slices, typically ranks.  
    fn ucorrelation(self, v: &[usize]) -> f64;
    /// Potentially useful clone-recast of &[usize] to Vec<f64>
    fn indx_to_f64 (self) -> Vec<f64>;
}
```

## Trait Printing

This trait is implemented for generic individual items `T`, for slices `&[T]` and for slices of vecs `&[Vec<T>]`

```Rust
/// Trait to serialize slices of generic items (vectors) and slices of
/// Vecs of generic items (matrices). Turns them all into printable strings.
pub trait Printing<T> {
    /// Method `gr()` to serialize and make the resulting string
    /// bold green when printed.
    /// This is the default implementation applicable to all types that
    /// trait `Printing` is implemented for
    fn gr(self) -> String  where  Self: Sized,    {
        format!("{GR}{}{UN}", self.to_str())
    }
    /// Method to serialize generic items, slices, and slices of Vecs.
    /// Can be implemented on any other types.
    fn to_str(self) -> String;
}
```

## Release Notes (Latest First)

**Version 1.0.7** - Renamed function `occurs` to `occurs_multiple` and added a simple linear count of item occurences: `occurs`.

**Version 1.0.6** - Some cosmetic changes to the code, readme and tests, no change of functionality.

**Version 1.0.5** - Added `partition_indexed` for partitioning into two sets of indices about a pivot. Moved all random number generating functions into new module `random.rs` (import changed to: `random::*`). Moved the implementations of Printing trait to new module `printing.rs` (this has no effect on users).

**Version 1.0.4** - here!() now highlights the (first) error in bold red. Added fast random number generation functions `ranf64, ranv64, ranvu8, ranvvf64, rannvvu8`.

**Version 1.0.3** - Added utilities functions `maxt, mint, minmaxt`. Rationalised the functions for printing generic slices and slices of vectors. They are now turned into two chainable methods in trait `Printing`: `.to_str()` and `.gr()`. The latter also serialises slices to strings but additionally makes them bold green.

**Version 1.0.2** - Added function `occurs` that efficiently counts occurrences of specified items in a set with repetitions.

**Version 1.0.1** - Some code style tidying up. Added function `binsearchdesc` for completeness and symmetry with `binsearch`.

**Version 1.0.0** - `indxvec` has been stable for some time now, so it gets promoted to v1.0.0. There are some improvements to `README.md` to mark the occasion.

**Version 0.2.12** - added utility function `printvv` to prettyprint vectors of vectors.

**Version 0.2.11** - added some badges and improved `readme`.

**Version 0.2.9** - added struct MinMax for returning values from function 'minmax' and displaying them. Removed function `wt` used previously for displaying them as tuples.

**Version 0.2.6** - added `unindexf64` for convenience. Same as `unindex` but the output is always converted to `Vec<f64>`.

**Version 0.2.5** - added `memsearchdesc_indexed` = binary search of a descending indexed set.

**Version 0.2.4** - added helper function `wt` = write tuple. Added `memsearchdesc` = binary search of a descending set.

**Version 0.2.3** - general tidying up and readme update.

**Version 0.2.2** - replaced GV and GI with functions `wv` and `wi` respectively. Added `revindex` to `Indices` trait, so that it can be functionally chained with its other methods.

**Version 0.2.1** - moved GI from `rstats` to here. Fixed `minmax`.

**Version 0.2.0** - added set operations: `sansrepeat, member, memsearch, memsearch_indexed, unite, unite_indexed, intersect, intersect_indexed, diff, diff_indexed`.  They are also used, with type/struct  wrappers, by crate `sets`.
